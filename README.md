Use `GEE_export_code.js` to put into [Google Earth Engine's (GEE) Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). Play around with different time ranges and geospatial boundaries to understand more about the data. 
There's also a small part of the code at the end to export the data (as a TIF) into your own Google Drive.

Use `tif_to_rds.R` to read the exported TIF as an `sf` object in R and save as an RDS file.
